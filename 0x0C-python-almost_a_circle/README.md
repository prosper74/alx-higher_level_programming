# Python - Almost a Circle
This project explores various Python concepts and techniques, including unit testing, serialization, JSON file handling, *args and **kwargs, and named arguments in functions. It aims to provide practical examples and explanations to deepen understanding of these topics.

### Unit Testing
Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure they behave as expected. In a large project, unit testing helps maintain code quality, identify bugs early, and facilitate refactoring. To implement unit testing in a large project:

- Write test cases for each unit or function.
- Use a testing framework like unittest or pytest to organize and run tests.
- Automate test execution using continuous integration tools.
- Maintain a comprehensive test suite to ensure code reliability and stability.

### Serialization and Deserialization
Serialization is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream or string representation, typically for storage or transmission. Deserialization is the reverse process, where the serialized data is converted back into a Python object. In Python, serialization and deserialization can be achieved using libraries like JSON, Pickle, or YAML. To serialize and deserialize a class:
- Implement methods to convert the class instance into a dictionary or JSON string (serialization).
- Implement methods to create a class instance from a dictionary or JSON string (deserialization).

### JSON File Handling
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for storing and transmitting structured data. In Python, you can write and read `JSON` files using the json module. To write to a `JSON` file, use the `json.dump()` function. To read from a `JSON` file, use the `json.load()` function.

### *args and **kwargs
`*args` and `**kwargs` are special syntax in Python used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.

- `*args` allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. Inside the function, args will be a tuple containing all the positional arguments.
- `**kwargs` allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments (key-value pairs) to a function. Inside the function, kwargs will be a dictionary containing all the keyword arguments.

### Named Arguments in Functions
In Python, you can handle named arguments in a function by defining function parameters with default values. Named arguments allow callers to specify only the arguments they want to override, making function calls more flexible. For example:
```
def example_func(param1, param2=0, param3="default"):
    # Function body
```

In this function, param1 is a required positional argument, while param2 and param3 have default values and can be omitted during function calls. Callers can override the default values by providing named arguments explicitly.
